# Walkthrough - Yanri's Website

I have updated the **Music** page to include a tracklist of songs from your playlist.

## Changes Made

### Music Page
- **Tracklist**: Added a list of songs extracted from your playlist below the video player.
- **Links**: Each song title links directly to the YouTube video.

## How to Customize

### Adding More Songs
1.  Open [music.html](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/music.html).
2.  Find the `<ul>` list under `<h3>Tracklist</h3>`.
3.  Add a new line: `<li><a href="YOUTUBE_LINK" target="_blank">SONG TITLE</a></li>`.

## Verification
Open [music.html](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/music.html) in your browser. You should see:
- The YouTube playlist player.
- A list of songs like "SHOTGUN KILLER" and "Bruce & Bongo" below it.
- Clicking a song title opens it in a new tab.
