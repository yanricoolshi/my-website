# Walkthrough - Yanri's Website

I have updated the site with your **Banner** and the **Transparent Green** theme from the mockup.

## Changes Made

### Visual Overhaul
- **Banner**: Added `yanribanner.png` to the top of every page.
- **Transparent Theme**: The main content area is now a semi-transparent green gradient, allowing the **Water GIF** to show through.
- **Navigation**: Renamed "About" to **About Me...**.
- **Menu**: Updated the menu background to blend with the new green theme.

### Page Updates
- **`index.html`**, **`art.html`**, **`music.html`**: All updated with the new header and navigation.

## How to Customize

### Changing the Banner
1.  Replace `images/yanribanner.png` with a new image file of the same name.
2.  Or, open the HTML files and change the `src` in `<img src="images/yanribanner.png" ... />`.

## Verification
Open `index.html` in your browser. You should see:
- Your **Yanri Banner** at the top.
- The **Water GIF** visible through the green content box.
- The menu link saying **About Me...**.
