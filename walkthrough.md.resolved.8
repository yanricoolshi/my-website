# Walkthrough - Yanri's Website

I have updated the **Music** page to include your YouTube playlist.

## Changes Made

### Music Page
- **YouTube Embed**: Replaced the music player placeholder with an embedded YouTube playlist (`PLTXibJayE9VpiOH-ADAL0f97Z5J42Kfna`).
- **Styling**: Adjusted the container to fit the video player naturally.

## How to Customize

### Changing the Playlist
1.  Open [music.html](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/music.html).
2.  Find the `<iframe>` tag.
3.  Replace the `list=...` part of the URL with your new playlist ID.

## Verification
Open [music.html](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/music.html) in your browser. You should see:
- A YouTube video player loaded with your playlist.
- You can play videos directly on the page.
