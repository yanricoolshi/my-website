# Walkthrough - Frutiger Aero / Windows 7 Theme

I have completely transformed the website into a **Frutiger Aero / Windows 7** masterpiece! The site now looks like a floating glass window on a desktop.

## Changes Made

### Aero Glass Theme
- **[style.css](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/style.css)**: Completely rewritten to implement:
    - **Glass Effect**: `backdrop-filter: blur(15px)` and semi-transparent white backgrounds.
    - **Window Frame**: Inner white borders and deep drop shadows.
    - **Typography**: Switched to `Segoe UI` for that authentic Windows feel.
    - **Toolbar**: The menu now looks like a taskbar or toolbar, using your `button-bg.png`.

### New "Window" Structure
- **[index.html](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/index.html), [art.html](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/art.html), [music.html](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/music.html)**:
    - Added a **Window Title Bar** with an icon, title, and control buttons (Minimize, Maximize, Close).
    - Wrapped content in a **Window Body** for proper scrolling and layout.
    - Added a **Start Orb** placeholder at the bottom.

## How to Add Your Assets
I have set up the code to look for specific filenames. Please refer to the **[Asset Guide](asset_guide.md)** for a checklist of what to create and where to save it.

### Quick Checklist:
1.  **Wallpaper**: Save as `images/wallpaper.jpg`.
2.  **Start Orb**: Save as `images/start-orb.png`.
3.  **Window Icon**: Save as `images/window-icon.png`.
4.  **Close Button**: Save as `images/close-btn.png`.

## Verification
Open [index.html](file:///C:/Users/akoda/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b3dc8f9a-8701-45a6-9bc0-a049d36ab941/index.html) in your browser. You should see:
- A glass window floating in the center.
- Your `button-bg.png` applied to the menu links.
- Placeholders for the wallpaper, start orb, and window controls (which will appear once you add the images).
